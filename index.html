               <h2>Biography</h2>
               <p>Siddhartha was born in Lumbini in modern day Nepal. His father was Suddhodan, the chief of the Shakya nation, one of several ancient tribes on the growing state of Kosala. His mother was Queen Maya, King Sudhodhana's wife.

                The day of the Buddha's birth is widely celebrated in Buddhist countries as Vesak Day. Gautama was born a prince, destined to a luxurious life, with three palaces (one for each season) especially built for him. On the night Gautama was conceived, Māyādevī dreamt that a white elephant entered her right side, and following the dream Siddharta was born from her right side (see image right). Various sources hold that the Buddha's mother died at his birth, a few days or seven days later. During the birth celebrations, the seer Asita announced that this baby would either become a great king ( chakravartin) or a great holy man. His father, King Śuddhodana, wishing for Gautama to be a great king, shielded his son from religious teachings or knowledge of human suffering.
                
                While later tradition and legend characterized Śuddhodana as a hereditary monarch, the descendant of the Solar Dynasty of Ikṣvāku (Pāli: Okkāka), many scholars believe that Śuddhodana was the elected chief of a tribal confederacy.</p>
               <p>When the young Prince Siddhārtha Gautama was a baby, an ascetic named Kaladevala went into the Trāyastriṃśa heaven and predicted that the young prince would become the Buddha. As the boy reached the age of 16, his father arranged his marriage to Yaśodharā ( Pāli: Yasodharā), a cousin of the same age. In time, she gave birth to a son, Rahula. Gautama spent 29 years as a prince in Kapilavastu, a place now situated in Nepal. Although his father ensured that Gautama was provided with everything he could want or need, Gautama felt that material wealth was not the ultimate goal of life.</p>
               <p>Gautama then chose the robes of a mendicant monk and headed to Magadha in what is today Bihar in India. He began his training in the ascetic life and practicing vigorous techniques of physical and mental austerity. Gautama proved quite adept at these practices, and surpassed even his teachers.

                However, he found no answer to his questions regarding freedom from sufferings Leaving behind his caring teachers, he and a small group of close companions set out to take their austerities even further. Gautama tried to find enlightenment through complete deprivation of worldly goods, including food, and became a complete ascetic. After nearly starving himself to death (some sources claim that he nearly drowned), Gautama began to reconsider his path. Then, he remembered a moment in childhood in which he had been watching his father start the season's plowing, and he had fallen into a naturally concentrated and focused state that was blissful and refreshing.</p>
